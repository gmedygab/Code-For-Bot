## Trading Strategies

Code For Bot supports various trading strategies. Here are a few popular ones:

### Moving Average Crossover

This strategy uses two moving averages. When the short-term average crosses above the long-term average, it signals a buy. Conversely, when it crosses below, it signals a sell.

### RSI (Relative Strength Index)

The RSI measures the speed and change of price movements. A value above 70 indicates an overbought condition, while below 30 indicates oversold. You can set buy and sell signals based on these thresholds.

### MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence)

The MACD strategy involves two moving averages. The MACD line and the signal line indicate potential buy or sell signals based on their crossover points.
